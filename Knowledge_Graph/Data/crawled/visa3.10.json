This will show the processing times for recently decided applications. It is a guide only and not specific to your application.\nYour application might take longer to process if:\nyou do not fill it in correctly\nyou do not include all of the documents we need or we need more information from you and/or\nyour information takes a long time to verify.\nWe cannot process your application if you do not pay the correct visa application charge.

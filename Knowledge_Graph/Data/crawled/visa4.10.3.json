In some instances, this may not be possible. This may occur where the composition of the family changes after:\nthe primary visa applicant has already submitted their SESR visa application and it is still pending a decision\na SESR visa has already been granted to the primary visa holder\nWhen this occurs and you want to join your family member on their visa, you must apply separately by submitting a visa application in your own right. This is known as subsequent entrant.\nWhen you submit your visa application for a subsequent entrant, you are required to attach a written letter from your family memberâ€™s work sponsor (employer) extending their sponsorship obligation to include you as a family member in the nomination.\nThis requirement is intended to ensure the employer is aware of all the family members to whom their sponsorship obligations will extend.\nDiscuss this matter with the work sponsor in the first instance before lodging your subsequent entrant visa application.\nWith this visa, you can\nstay in Australia while the visa is valid\nlive, work and study only in designated regional areas of Australia for up to 5 years\ntravel to and from Australia as many times as you want while the visa is valid\nSpecified region\nYou can live, work and study only in a designated regional area.

You can stay in Australia for a period of up to 5 years. Your visa will expire at the same time as your family member who is the primary SESR visa holder.\nStay longer\nYou can't stay in Australia longer by extending this visa.

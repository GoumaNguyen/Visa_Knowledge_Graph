This visa does not lead to permanent residence. You cannot apply for a permanent or temporary parent visa when you have applied for or hold this visa.\nYou can apply to stay in Australia for up to 3 or 5 years at a time, with a cumulative maximum stay of 10 years..\nIf you held a Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa and were outside Australia on 1 July 2021, your visa period was automatically extended by 18 months under the COVID-19 visa concessions. If your visa was extended under this concession, the additional 18 months will not count towards your cumulative 10 year maximum stay.\nYou can stay for the period or date(s) specified on the visa grant letter. We will determine how long your visa is granted for.\nThings we might consider when determining your stay period include:\nhow long you want to stay\nthe sponsorship cessation date\nYou might not be granted the length of stay you want.\nIf you have been granted a Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa, the sponsor’s other parent cannot be granted a visa with a later end date.\nFor example:\nParent A and Parent B are both sponsored by Child A. Parent A applies for a Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa, and the visa is granted for three (3) years. Parent B applies for a three (3) year Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa some 18 months later. In this scenario, Parent B can only be granted a Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa for the remaining period of Parent A’s visa validity period (in this case, 12 months). The same amount of Visa Application Charge is payable for Parent A and Parent B.\nYour visa will end:\non the date specified on the visa grant letter\nwe cancel it\nif your sponsor withdraws their sponsorship and you do not find a new Parent Sponsor\nif we cancel the sponsorship\nStay longer\nYou cannot stay in Australia longer by extending this visa.

This applies unless we have issued you with Permission to Apply in Australia (but not in immigration clearance).\nIf you apply for another Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa whilst outside of Australia, you will not be eligible for this visa unless you have been outside of Australia for at least 90 consecutive days since your relevant departure day.\nYou can calculate your relevant departure day based on your location when your last Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa ceased:\nIf you were in Australia – your relevant departure day is the first day you left Australia after your visa ceased.\nIf you were outside of Australia - your relevant departure day is the last day you left Australia while the visa was in effect.\nIf you have held Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visas for the cumulative maximum 10 year period, you will not be eligible for a further Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa. You must either depart Australia or apply for and be granted another kind of visa that will allow you to remain in Australia.\nInclude family\nYou cannot include family members in your visa application.\nSponsorship\nYou must have an approved Parent Sponsor to apply for this visa.\nYour sponsor’s household is limited to one sponsorship at a time.\nYour sponsor’s sponsorship can cover up to 2 parents per household at a time.\nYour sponsor cannot lodge a new sponsorship application until their current approved sponsorship ends.\nCost\nThis visa costs from:\nAUD5,895 for a visa of up to 3 years; or\nAUD11,785 for a visa of up to 5 years.\nYou pay for this visa in 2 parts called instalments.\nPay the first instalment when you apply.

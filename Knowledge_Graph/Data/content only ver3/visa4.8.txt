For citizenship purposes, your permanent residence starts on either the day:

you enter Australia on this visa, if you are outside Australia.
Travel
You can travel to and from Australia as many times as you want for 5 years from the date we grant you this visa. This is as long as the travel facility remains valid.
If you want to travel after the initial 5-year travel facility, you must apply for and be granted a Resident Return visa so that you can re-enter Australia as a permanent resident.

Include family
You must include all members of the family unit who wish to come to Australia with you in your application. You will not be able to add them to your application after you have submitted your application.
Where you have included a non-biological child a member of the family unit due to adoption, you need to provide further supporting evidence.
Generally, adoptions are either formal or customary. In a formal adoption, the child who is adopted becomes the legal child of the adopting parents and a legal member of the adopting family.
Customary adoptions are generally not recognised in Australia. Australia recognises adoptions which formally establish parental rights and responsibilities. These adoptions must comply with specific legal requirements to be recognised under Australian migration law.
For visa purposes, members of the family unit do not include your parents or partners parents, aunts, uncles, or cousins.
Family members who apply for this visa must meet our health and character requirements. They must have also complied with the conditions of any previous visas held. Family members not coming to Australia might also need to meet health and character requirements.

Temporary Skill Shortage visa (subclass 482)
Subsequent entrant
This visa is for family members of subclass 457 and TSS visa holders who are applying separately for their TSS visa and wish to join the primary subclass 457 or TSS visa holder in Australia.

About this visa
Usually you apply for your visa at the same time and combined with the visa application of the main applicant. In some instances, this may not be possible. This may occur where the composition of the family changes after:
the main applicant has already submitted their application for a TSS visa and it is still pending a decision
a subclass 457 or TSS visa has already been granted to the primary TSS visa applicant
When this occurs and you want to join the primary applicant on their visa, you must apply separately by submitting a visa application in you own right. This is known as subsequent entrant.
When you submit your visa application for a subsequent entrant, you are required to attach a written letter from the sponsor extending their sponsorship obligation to include you as a family member in the nomination.
This requirement is intended to ensure the primary applicant’s employer is aware of all the family members to whom their sponsorship obligations will extend.
Discuss this matter with the sponsor in the first instance before lodging your subsequent entrant visa application.
With this visa, you can
live and work in Australia
study (you won’t receive government assistance)
travel to and from Australia as many times as you want while the visa is valid
if eligible, apply for permanent residence
Your visa will come with conditions attached to it. To see your conditions refer to your visa grant letter or use VEVO.
Cost
Primary visa holder holds a TSS visa
The visa application charge for a subsequent entrant application will be calculated based on the stream in which the primary visa was granted (that is, a short-term, medium-term or labour agreement stream).
Primary visa holder holds a subclass 457 visa
In cases where a primary visa holder holds a subclass 457 visa, and not a TSS visa, the visa application charge for subsequent entrant applications is calculated as per regulation 1240(2)(a)(ii) – "for any other applicant", with the charges being as follows:
base application charge - AUD3,115.00
additional applicant charge for applicants 18 and over - AUD3,115.00
additional applicant charge for applicants under 18 - AUD780.00
Note: if the sole applicant on a subsequent entrant application is under 18 years of age, they will be charged the base application charge and not the additional applicant charge.
You might also have to pay other costs for health checks, police certificates and biometrics.
To work out what your visa will cost use the Visa pricing estimator The estimator does not take into account the other costs.
How long you can stay
This is a temporary visa. You can stay in Australia for as long as your visa is valid.
Stay longer

Family members who apply for the visa must meet our health and character requirements.
Primary visa must have been submitted or decided
Family members cannot be added to a primary visa applicant’s TSS visa application after it has been submitted.
A subsequent entrant application should be submitted if the primary visa applicant has already submitted their visa application and you were not included as a family member in their application and:

the primary visa applicant has been granted a subclass 457 or a TSS visa and you wish to join them in Australia

Work and Holiday visa (subclass 462)
Third Work and Holiday visa
This visa lets people 18 to 30 years old (inclusive) who currently hold, or who have held, a second Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa, have a third working holiday in Australia.








With this visa, you can
do short- term work in Australia to help pay for your holiday
study for up to 4 months
travel to and from Australia as many times as you want
Work
You can do any kind of work on this visa.
Usually, you can only work for the same employer for 6 months. 
Note: The 6-month work limitation resets when you are granted a third subclass 462 visa. This means you can work another 6 months for someone you worked for on your first and/or second visa.
If the main purpose of your stay is to work, consider a work visa.
Study
You can study for up to 4 months (17 weeks).
If the main purpose of your stay is to study, consider a Student visa.
How long you can stay
This depends on your circumstances when we grant the visa. Your grant notification will tell you how long you can stay in Australia and you can also use VEVO to check your visa details and conditions.
You are in Australia on your second subclass 462 visa or a bridging visa
The bridging visa must be the one you were granted after your second subclass 462 visa expired.
You can stay in Australia for up to 12 months from the date your second Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa expired or would have expired.
You are in Australia on a different visa
You can stay in Australia for 12 months from the date we grant the visa.
Time spent outside Australia after the visa starts does not extend the visa.
You are outside Australia
You can stay in Australia for 12 months from the date you enter Australia.
You must enter Australia within 12 months of the date we grant the visa. We will not extend or defer this timeframe.
Your Work and Holiday visa starts on the date you enter or transit through Australia even if you hold any other temporary visa including:
a Special Purpose visa (SPV)
an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA)
a Crew Travel Authority (CTA)
a Maritime Crew visa (MCV)
It is important that you only apply for a Work and Holiday visa once you are ready to enter Australia on that visa. Once we grant your Work and Holiday visa and you travel to Australia and are immigration cleared at the border, the 12-month visa period of stay will automatically start upon entry, regardless of the purpose of your visit.
Stay longer
You can't:
stay in Australia longer by extending this visa
get a fourth Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa if you have already held three Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visas in Australia
To stay longer in Australia, explore your visa options.
Stay longer on a visitor visa
Generally, we don't grant a Visitor visa after you have been in Australia on a Work and Holiday (subclass 462) visa.
If you want to apply for a Visitor visa to stay longer in Australia and the Visitor visa would result in you staying longer than 12 consecutive months in Australia, you must show there are exceptional circumstances.
For this visa, exceptional circumstances might be that a close family member in Australia has died or is seriously ill and you are required to stay in Australia to provide assistance or support.
Include family
You can't include family members in your application.
You can't be accompanied by dependent children while you are in Australia on this visa.

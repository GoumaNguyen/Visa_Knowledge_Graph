Include other family members
You can include other family members (called 'secondary applicants') in your visa application. The family members you can add will depend on whether you currently hold a subclass 457 or TSS visa.
You have not previously held a subclass 457 or TSS visa
If you have not previously held a subclass 457 or TSS visa, the secondary applicants you can include in your visa application are those who are members of the family unit.
You currently hold a subclass 457 or TSS visa
If you currently hold a subclass 457 or TSS visa and you are applying for a subsequent subclass TSS visa, the secondary applicants who can be included in your application are::
one of the members of the family unit, or
a person who currently holds a subclass 457 or TSS visa that was granted on the basis that they were a member of the family unit at the time, and is currently one of the following:
your spouse or de facto partner
your or your spouse's or de facto partner's child or step-child who is not engaged, married or in a de facto relationship, and is:
younger than 23
aged 23 or older and fully or mostly reliant on you or your partner because they cannot work, due to a partial or total physical or mental disability
is a dependent child of your or your spouse or de facto partner's child or step-child 
To be granted the visa, secondary applicants must be included in the main applicant's nomination, or provide written evidence that the sponsor who nominated the main applicant agrees that the secondary applicant can be a secondary sponsored person.
Secondary applicants who apply for the visa must meet our health and character requirements.
You can’t add family members to your visa application after it has been submitted. 
If you have submitted your visa application and it is being processed by the Department, family members that were not included in your visa application can lodge a subsequent entrant application.
Alternatively, if we have granted you a visa, family members may apply to join you in Australia later as a subsequent entrant.
Cost
The visa costs AUD3,115.00 for the main applicant and each dependant 18 years and over.
It costs AUD780.00 for each dependant under 18 years old.
You will have to pay other costs for English language tests, health checks, police certificates and biometrics.

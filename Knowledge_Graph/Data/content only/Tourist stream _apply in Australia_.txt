Visitor visa (subclass 600)
Tourist stream (apply in Australia)
This visa stream lets you visit Australia as a tourist, to visit family and friends or for purposes other than business or medical treatment.








With this visa you can
visit family or friends
be here as a tourist, for a cruise, or for any purpose except business or medical treatment
You can study or train for up to 3 months on this visa. But if your main reason for travelling to Australia is study, a student visa might be more appropriate.
You can't work.
Cruise
You will need a visa if you enter Australia during a cruise.
If your cruise is a round trip cruise, the time you spend on the cruise counts as time spent in Australia. We do not consider you to have left Australia. A round trip cruise will not reset your stay period on your visa.
Ask your cruise operator or travel agent if we consider your cruise to be a round trip cruise.
How long you can stay
This is a temporary visa. 
You can stay for the period or dates specified on the visa grant letter. We determine the length of your visa on a case by case basis. Things we might consider when determining your stay period include:
how long you want to stay
why you want to stay in Australia
We might not grant you the length of stay you want.
We can grant this visa with multiple entry or no travel.
If we grant you a visa with multiple entry, you can leave and return to Australia on the visa while it is valid.
You may need to show there are exceptional circumstances if you want to stay in Australia:
as the holder of one or more visitor visas
and for more than 12 consecutive months
If you want to stay longer or permanently in Australia you will need to apply for a visa that allows this.
Stay longer
You can't stay in Australia longer by extending this visa. You must apply for another visa.

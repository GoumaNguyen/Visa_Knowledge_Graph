You can switch between complying significant investments if:
you reinvest the funds you withdraw from an investment into other complying significant investments within 30 days
the sum reinvested should be the same as the sum withdrawn irrespective of any gains and losses due to market exposures
If you reinvest funds into a complying significant investment within 30 days, we regard that as holding it continuously.
If you withdraw funds from venture capital or emerging company investments, you must reinvest the funds into venture capital or emerging companies.
If you withdraw funds from the 'balancing investment' category of investments, you can reinvest them into another balancing investment, venture capital or emerging companies.
If you withdraw funds from venture capital because the venture capital investment has been realised, you must reinvest those funds. You can reinvest it in any eligible complying significant investment.
Income that you earn from your complying significant investment in Australia may be subject to tax under Australian taxation law.
The rules that were in force at the time that you applied for your first Business Innovation and Investment (Provisional) visa (subclass 188) in the Significant Investor stream will continue to apply for the duration of your provisional visa, including any Extension stream visas you apply for that relate to that provisional visa. 
You might want to seek independent legal advice to ensure that an investment is a 'complying significant investment'. It is your responsibility to ensure your investment choices comply with the requirements of this visa.

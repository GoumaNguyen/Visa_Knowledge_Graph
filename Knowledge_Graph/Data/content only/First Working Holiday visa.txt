Working Holiday visa (subclass 417)
First Working Holiday visa
This visa lets people 18 to 30 years old (or 35 years old for some countries) have their first extended holiday in Australia and work here to help fund their trip.








With this visa you can
do short-term work in Australia to help pay for your holiday
study for up to 4 months
travel to and from Australia as many times as you want
do 3 months of specified work to become eligible for a second Working Holiday visa
Work
You can do any kind of work on this visa.
Usually, you can only work for the same employer for 6 months.
If the main purpose of your stay is to work, consider a work visa. Explore visa options.
Study
You can study for up to 4 months (17 weeks).
If the main purpose of your stay is to study, consider a Student visa.
How long you can stay
This is a temporary visa. You must enter Australia within 12 months of the date we grant it. We will not extend or defer this timeframe.
The visa's period of stay starts on the date you enter Australia. Once you have entered, you can:
stay in Australia for up to 12 months
leave and re-enter Australia as many times as you like in those 12 months
Please Note:
You do not need to apply for another visa to enter Australia, such as an eVisitor (subclass 651) visa, once you have been granted your Working Holiday Visa.
If you apply for and are granted another visa (such as subclass 651 visa) after the grant of your Working Holiday visa, your Working Holiday visa (and related work rights) will cease on the date that visa is granted.
If your first Working Holiday visa ceased due to the grant of another visa, such as an eVisitor visa, and you entered Australia on that other visa, you will not be able to apply for another first Working Holiday visa while you are in Australia. 
You have another visa
Your Working Holiday visa starts on the date you enter or transit through Australia even if you hold any other temporary visa including:
a Special Purpose visa
an Electronic Travel Authority
a Crew Travel Authority
a Maritime Crew visa
It is important that you only apply for a Working Holiday visa once you are ready to enter Australia on that visa. Once we grant your Working Holiday visa and you travel to Australia and are immigration cleared at the border, the 12-month visa period of stay will automatically start upon entry, regardless of the purpose of your visit.
Stay longer
You can't stay in Australia longer by extending this visa. If you want to stay in Australia longer, apply for another visa.
Explore your visa options to stay longer in Australia.
You could apply for a second Working Holiday visa if you are eligible.
Stay longer on a Visitor visa
The total time you will be permitted to stay on your first Working Holiday visa and then a Visitor visa is 12 consecutive months.
If you want to apply for a Visitor visa to stay longer in Australia and the Visitor visa would result in you staying longer than 12 consecutive months in Australia, you must show there are exceptional circumstances.
For this visa, exceptional circumstances might be that a close family member in Australia has died or is seriously ill and you are required to stay in Australia to provide assistance or support.
Include family
You can't include family members in your application.
You can't be accompanied by dependent children while you are in Australia on this visa.

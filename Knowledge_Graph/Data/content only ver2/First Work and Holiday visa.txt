Work and Holiday visa (subclass 462)
First Work and Holiday visa
This visa lets people 18 to 30 years old (inclusive) have an extended holiday in Australia and work here to help fund their trip.








With this visa you can
do short-term work in Australia to help pay for your holiday
study for up to 4 months
travel to and from Australia as many times as you want
do 3 months of specified subclass 462 work to become eligible for a second Work and Holiday visa
Work
You can do any kind of work on this visa.
Usually, you can only work for the same employer for 6 months.
If the main purpose of your stay is to work, consider a work visa. Explore visa options.
Study
You can study for up to 4 months (17 weeks).
If the main purpose of your stay is to study, consider a Student visa. 
How long you can stay
This is a temporary visa. You must enter Australia within 12 months of the date we grant it. We will not extend or defer this timeframe. 
The visaâ€™s period of stay starts on the date you enter Australia. Once you have entered you can:
stay in Australia for up to 12 months
leave and re-enter Australia as many times as you like in those 12 months
Note:
You do not need to apply for another visa to enter Australia, such as an eVisitor (subclass 651) visa, once you have been granted your Work and Holiday Visa.
If you apply for and are granted another visa (such as subclass 651 visa) after the grant of your Work and Holiday visa, your Work and Holiday visa (and related work rights) will cease on the date that visa is granted.
If your first Work and Holiday visa ceased due to the grant of another visa, such as an eVisitor visa, and you entered Australia on that other visa, you will not be able to apply for another first Work and Holiday visa while you are in Australia. 
You have another visa
Your Work and Holiday visa starts on the date you enter or transit through Australia even if you hold any other temporary visa including:
a Special Purpose visa 
an Electronic Travel Authority
a Crew Travel Authority
a Maritime Crew visa
It is important that you only apply for a Work and Holiday visa once you are ready to enter Australia on that visa. Once we grant your Work and Holiday visa and you travel to Australia and are immigration cleared at the border, the 12-month visa period of stay will automatically start upon entry, regardless of the purpose of your visit.

The spouse or de facto partner of the main applicant who did not make a combined application at the initial lodgement of the subclass 188 visa, can make a subsequent entrant application. A subclass 188 visa can only be granted to a subsequent entrant after the main applicant’s subclass 188 visa is granted.

In order for the main applicant to be granted the visa, family members who are not coming to Australia must meet our character requirements, and might have to meet our health requirements.

Learn more about conditions for this visa.
In particular, you must commit to continue to maintain your investment and comply with Australian workplace laws.
To be eligible for the grant of a Business Innovation and Investment (Permanent) visa (subclass 888) in the Investor stream, you must live in the State or Territory in which you made the designated investment for at least 2 years during the period your provisional visa is valid.
Maintain your investment
If you were invited to apply on or after 1 July 2021
You must make a complying significant investment of at least AUD2.5 million. You must hold complying significant investments continuously for the life of your provisional visa.
You can switch between complying significant investments if:
you reinvest the funds you withdraw from an investment into other complying significant investments within 30 days
the sum withdrawn is the same as, or less than, the sum reinvested irrespective of any gains and losses due to market exposures
If you reinvest funds into a complying significant investment within 30 days, we count that as holding them continuously.
If you withdraw funds from venture capital or emerging company investments, you must reinvest the funds into venture capital or emerging companies.
If you withdraw funds from the 'balancing investment' category of investments, you can reinvest them into another balancing investment, venture capital or emerging companies.
If you withdraw funds from venture capital because the venture capital investment has been realised, you must reinvest those funds. You can reinvest them in any eligible complying significant investment.
Income that you earn from your complying significant investment in Australia may be subject to tax under Australian taxation law.
You might want to seek independent legal advice to ensure that an investment is a ‘complying significant investment’. It is your responsibility to ensure your investment options comply with this visa's requirements.
For more information about complying significant investments, see the Complying Investment Framework information sheet, and for the 1 July 2021 changes see Business Innovation and Investment Program: Getting a better deal for Australia.
If you were invited to apply before 1 July 2021
You must genuinely have a realistic commitment to continue to maintain business or investment activity in Australia after the designated investment matures. 
To be eligible for the Business Innovation and Investment (Permanent) visa (subclass 888) Investor stream, you must maintain your investment in an Australian state or territory for at least 4 years.
Income that you earn from your investment in Australia is subject to Australian taxation law.

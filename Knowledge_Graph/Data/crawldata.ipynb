Stay up to 3 months each time you enter Australia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith this visa you can\\nTravel to Australia:\\nas a tourist - for example, to cruise or have a holiday \\nto visit family or friends\\nas a business visitor\\nYou can study or train for up to 3 months in total on this visa. If your main reason for travelling to Australia is to study, you should apply for a student visa.\\nNote: You should apply for a Visitor (subclass 600) visa and complete the relevant health checks if you are seeking to:\\ntrain at a childcare centre\\nstudy to be a doctor, dentist, nurse or paramedic\\nenter health care or hospital environments.\\nCruise\\nYou will need a visa if you enter Australia during a cruise.\\nIf your cruise is a round trip cruise starting from Australia, the time you spend on the cruise counts as time spent in Australia - that is, we do not consider you have left Australia. A round trip cruise will not reset your stay period on your visa.\\nAsk your cruise operator or travel agent if we consider your cruise to be a round trip cruise.\\nBusiness visitor\\nAs a business visitor, you can:\\nmake general business or employment enquiries\\ninvestigate, negotiate, enter into or review a business contract\\nconduct activities as part of an official government visit\\ntake part in a conference, trade fair or seminar. The organisers can't pay you to take part.\\nYou can't:\\nwork for or provide services to a business or organisation based in Australia\\nsell goods or services directly to the public\\nThe ETA is not a work visa. You cannot undertake paid work for an Australian employer. If you work or intend to work in Australia on an ETA, your ETA may be cancelled. You may be removed or refused entry to Australia.\\nTo work in Australia, you must hold a visa that permits you to work. See Working in Australia.\\nHow long you can stay\\nThis is a temporary visa. It is valid for travel to Australia for either 12 months, or for the period your passport is valid, whichever is shorter.\\nThe visa is granted with multiple entry. You can leave and re-enter Australia as many times as you want while it is valid. You can remain in Australia for 3 months after each entry.\\nIf you stay in Australia for long periods or make frequent visits to Australia, we may ask you about your travel purpose next time you enter Australia. If you are found not to be a genuine visitor, your ETA may be cancelled.\\nIf you want to stay longer than 3 months at a time, you need to apply for a different visa that suits your circumstances.\\nThe 12 month visa period starts on the date it is granted unless you hold another substantive visa that is already in effect. \\nStay longer\\nYou can't stay in Australia longer by extending this visa. You must apply for another visa.\\nTo find out about other visas, explore your visa options.\\nIf you remain in Australia after your ETA ceases, and do not hold another visa to remain, you will become an unlawful non-citizen and you may be removed from Australia.\\nIncluding family\\nYou can't include family members, such as children or your spouse, in your application. Each family member, including those listed on your passport, must submit a separate application.\\nCost\\nThere is no Visa Application Charge (VAC) however there is an application service fee of AUD20 to use the Australian ETA app.\\nApply from\\nYou must be outside Australia when you apply for the ETA and outside Australia when the visa is granted.\\nProcessing times\\nIn most cases, you will be notified of the result of your ETA application immediately.\\nYour application might take longer to process if:\\nyou don't answer the questions in the ETA app correctly\\nwe need more information from you\\nyour information is hard to verify.\\nIf you have a criminal conviction in any country, we will need more information from you. You should apply for a Visitor visa (subclass 600) and provide evidence about your criminal convictions.\\nYour obligations\\nYou must meet all visa conditions and obey Australian laws.\\nHealth insurance\\nWe recommend you take out health insurance to cover any unforeseen medical treatment you might need in Australia. You are personally liable for all your healthcare costs while you are in Australia. Insurance can help limit your financial liability.\\nSee what we consider adequate health insurance.\\nLearn more about health insurance for overseas visitors.\\nReciprocal healthcare agreements\\nSome countries have a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Australia. Find out more from Services Australia about reciprocal healthcare agreements. \\nTravel\\nYou can travel outside Australia and return as many times as you want while the visa is valid.\\nVisa label\\nWe will digitally link your visa to your passport. You will not get a label in your passport.\\nYour ETA is attached to your current passport. If your current passport expires or you get a new passport:\\nyour ETA will cease\\nyou must apply for a new ETA\\nOther visas\\nMaritime Crew visa or Special Purpose visa\\nIf you hold a Maritime Crew visa or a Special Purpose visa and you are granted an ETA, you will hold both visas concurrently. When you arrive in Australia, you will enter on both visas. You can stay in Australia for the longer of the 2 visa periods.\\nIf the longer period exceeds 3 months the ETA will cease, but you can remain for the duration of the other visa's stay period.\\nAny other substantive visa\\nIf you hold any other substantive visa and an ETA when you arrive in Australia, you will enter Australia on your other substantive visa, not your ETA. Your ETA will come into effect when the other visa ceases.\\nHowever, the 3-month ETA stay period still begins when you enter Australia.\\nCheck your other substantive visa is valid for more than 3 months if you want to stay in Australia longer than the 3-month ETA stay period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n",

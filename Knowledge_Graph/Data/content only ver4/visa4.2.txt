Income that you earn from your complying significant investment in Australia may be subject to tax under Australian taxation law.
Note that the investment rules that were in force at the time that you applied for your Business Innovation and Investment (Provisional) visa (subclass 188) in the Significant Investor stream will continue to apply for the duration of your visa. This includes any Business Innovation and Investment (Provisional) visa (subclass 188) in the Significant Investor Extension stream visas you apply for that relate to your visa.
You might want to seek independent legal advice to ensure that an investment is a ‘complying significant investment’. It is your responsibility to ensure your investment options comply with this visa's requirements.
For more information about complying significant investments, see the Complying Investment Framework information sheet, and for the 1 July 2021 changes see Business Innovation and Investment Program: Getting a better deal for Australia.

Your EOI tells us about your skills, qualifications and investment experience. It lets us know which states and territories you would like to invest in. If you are eligible and a State or Territory government agency or Austrade nominates you, we might then invite you to apply for the visa.
Check that you meet all other eligibility criteria for the visa.
Each nominator will assess your EOI using their own criteria. Learn more:

You should have all these documents before you submit your EOI.

You could receive an invitation any time within 2 years of submitting your EOI. If you are invited to apply for the visa, you will receive an email from SkillSelect. Receiving an invitation does not mean you will be granted the visa.
If you are invited, you have 60 calendar days to apply for the visa. This time will not be extended.
You must demonstrate that you satisfy all eligibility criteria. If you can't meet the eligibility criteria, we will not grant you the visa.
If you do not apply for the visa after two invitations, your EOI will be removed from SkillSelect.
If you can't show that you can meet all other eligibility criteria, you should not apply for the visa at this time. If you want to update your EOI you can do that after the 60-day invitation period.
If this is your first invitation, you might be sent a second invitation after the 60-day invitation period.
If this is your second invitation, you will have to submit another EOI if you still want the visa.

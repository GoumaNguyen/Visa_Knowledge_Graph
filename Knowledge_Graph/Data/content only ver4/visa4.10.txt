You are exempt from this criteria if any of the following applies to you:
You must be nominated by an employer whose business is lawfully operating in Australia.
You must be employed to work in the nominated occupation and in a position within the sponsoring business or an associated entity of that business, located in a designated regional area of Australia.
Before you can apply for the visa, your employer will need to lodge a nomination application for you. They will only be able to do this if they are an approved work sponsor or have at least lodged an application to become a standard business sponsor.
If you are the primary visa applicant, you must show that you have the skills, qualifications and work experience necessary to perform the nominated occupation.
You must undertake a skills assessment to show this – see Have a positive skills assessment below.

You must have your skills assessed as suitable for the nominated occupation by the relevant assessing authority. The assessment will show us you have the skills to work in the nominated occupation.

You do not need to complete a skills assessment if at the time of application you held a Temporary Work (Skilled) visa (subclass 457) or Temporary Skill Shortage visa (subclass 482) for the nominated occupation and in order to be granted that visa, you were required to demonstrate your skills by providing a suitable skills assessment.
